# Email Digest Implementation - Deployment Notes

## Quick Summary
This PR implements feature #1201: Email digest of new hunts matching a player's interests.

**All acceptance criteria met:**
- ✅ Players can opt into a digest
- ✅ Content is based on categories they have played  
- ✅ Every email has a working unsubscribe

## What Changed

### New Database Tables
Run migration: `apps/web/lib/db/migrations/010_create_email_digest_tables.sql`

Creates 3 PostgreSQL tables:
- `player_email_preferences` - Email and subscription status
- `email_digest_sends` - Audit trail of sent digests
- `email_unsubscribe_tokens` - Secure unsubscribe tokens

### New Backend Services
- `apps/web/lib/email/` - Complete email digest service module
  - Types, database operations, digest generation, email sending
- `apps/web/components/emails/EmailDigest.tsx` - Email template

### New API Endpoints
- `POST/GET /api/v1/email-preferences` - Manage subscriptions
- `GET /api/v1/email-digest/unsubscribe?token=<>` - Handle unsubscribes
- `POST /api/v1/email-digest/send` - Admin: trigger sends

### Documentation
- `docs/EMAIL_DIGEST_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `docs/EMAIL_DIGEST_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Code examples
- `verify-email-digest.sh` - Deployment verification script

## Environment Setup

Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
ADMIN_API_TOKEN=your-secret-admin-token
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://hunty.app
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Run migration:**
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL < apps/web/lib/db/migrations/010_create_email_digest_tables.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy code** - same as any Next.js deployment

3. **Set environment variables** (Vercel/deployment platform)

4. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x verify-email-digest.sh
   ADMIN_TOKEN=your-token ./verify-email-digest.sh
   ```

5. **Set up cron job** (Vercel example in `vercel.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "crons": [{
       "path": "/api/v1/email-digest/send",
       "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
     }]
   }
   ```

## Key Features

### Player Opt-in
```bash
curl -X POST /api/v1/email-preferences \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "walletAddress": "GPLAYER123...",
    "email": "player@example.com",
    "digestSubscribed": true
  }'
```

### Personalized Content
- Analyzes player completion history
- Infers interested categories
- Recommends new hunts in those categories
- Excludes already-completed hunts

### Secure Unsubscribe
- Random 32-char tokens (90-day expiry)
- Single-use tokens
- Email includes unsubscribe link
- Compliant with anti-spam regulations

### Admin Control
- Trigger digests on-demand
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Configurable send frequency
- Audit trail in database

## Testing

Local testing:
```bash
# Subscribe
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/email-preferences \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"walletAddress":"GTEST...","email":"test@example.com","digestSubscribed":true}'

# Get preferences
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/email-preferences?wallet=GTEST...

# Dry run digest send
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/email-digest/send?dryRun=true \
  -H "X-Admin-Token: test-token"
```

See `verify-email-digest.sh` for automated testing.

## Monitoring

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Recent sends
SELECT * FROM email_digest_sends ORDER BY sent_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Subscription stats  
SELECT COUNT(*) as subscribed FROM player_email_preferences 
WHERE digest_subscribed = true;

-- Unsubscribe tracking
SELECT COUNT(*) as unsubscribed FROM email_unsubscribe_tokens 
WHERE used_at IS NOT NULL;
```

### Logs
- Search for "digest" in application logs
- Resend dashboard shows delivery metrics

## Rollback

If issues arise:

1. **Disable digest sends:**
   - Remove/delay cron job
   - Don't call `/api/v1/email-digest/send`

2. **Database (optional):**
   - Delete `player_email_preferences` table (doesn't affect core app)
   - Keep other tables for audit trail

3. **Code:**
   - Revert to previous commit
   - API endpoints will 404 but won't break anything
