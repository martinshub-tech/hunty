/**
 * Extracts the client's IP address from a request in a secure way.

 * reliably set by platforms like Vercel to the originating client IP.
 *
 * As a fallback for other environments or plain `Request` objects, it checks
 * common proxy headers. Crucially, when reading `x-forwarded-for`, it takes
 * only the *first* (leftmost) IP in the list, which is the standard way to
 * identify the originating client and prevent spoofing.
 *
 * @param req The incoming `Request` or `NextRequest` object.
 * @returns The client's IP address or "unknown" if it cannot be determined.
