/**
 * PostgreSQL client singleton.
 *
 * Uses the `postgres` package (https://github.com/porsager/postgres) which
 * automatically pools connections and is safe to import in Next.js serverless
 * functions — the pool is reused across warm invocations within the same
 * instance.
 *
 * The connection string is read from the DATABASE_URL environment variable.
 * If the variable is not set, a descriptive error is thrown at call time so
 * that misconfiguration surfaces early rather than appearing as a mysterious
 * runtime failure.
