/**
 * Aggregation logic for the public hunter profile (#/profile).
 *
 * The profile dashboard needs statistics that are derived from the *same*
 * on-chain leaderboard data that powers the public leaderboard surfaces, so
 * that a player's rank on their profile always matches their rank on the hunt
 * leaderboard. This module is the single source of truth for that derivation.
 *
 * Everything here is pure / server-safe: callers pass in the raw ranked
 * leaderboards and hunt metadata, and these helpers turn them into the
 * aggregate stats and completion timeline the profile page renders. Keeping it
 * free of React and `window` access means it is unit-testable and can run in a
 * server component for the public (wallet-less) profile view.
