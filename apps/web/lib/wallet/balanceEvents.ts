/**
 * A tiny pub/sub bridging blockchain writes to the wallet balance UI.
 *
 * Transaction code (`lib/contracts/*`, `lib/txToast.ts`) lives outside the
 * React tree and has no access to the react-query client, so it cannot update
 * cached balances directly. Instead it emits events here; `useWalletBalance`
 * subscribes and translates them into cache writes:
 *
 *   predictWalletBalanceChange({ xlmDelta: -5 })  → optimistic UI, applied now
 *   settleWalletBalance()                         → refetch the on-chain truth
 *
 * Keeping this a module-level emitter (rather than context) means a transaction
 * helper can report a balance change from anywhere without threading props or
 * hooks through the call site.
