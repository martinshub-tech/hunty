/**
 * Shared helpers for presenting a Stellar wallet address in the UI.

 * Before this module the codebase carried five separate copies of "truncate a

 * CompletedHuntCard, WalletContext), each with a slightly different shape.
 * Everything display-related now routes through here so an address looks the
 * same wherever it appears.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free: it is imported by the header, which is on every
